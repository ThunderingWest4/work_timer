# work_timer
inspired by pomodoro idea to help me keep a track on how long to work and breaks, organization

# How to use?
At the moment, this is command line based so if you have python installed, navigate to this folder and type 
`python timer.py <number of times to repeat cycle> <length of work period in mins> <length of break period in mins>` 
(but with actual numbers) into the cmd line. 
If it doesn't work, you may need to include the full path to your Python installation and then the whole `timer.py <> <> <>` chunk (it's easiest to just reinstall/edit installation and add to PATH on win10). If you don't have Python, you can't really use this until I compile it to an exe or some other format that's more universal.
