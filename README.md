# work_timer
inspired by pomodoro idea to help me keep a track on how long to work and breaks, organization

# How to use?
At the moment, this is command line based so if you have python installed, navigate to this folder and type "python timer.py <number of times to repeat cycle> <length of work period in mins> <length of break period in mins>" but with actual numbers into the cmd line. If it doesn't work, you may need to include the full path to your Python installation (it's easiest to just reinstall/edit installation and add to PATH on win10)
